* idea what i need to do:

The architect requires to make evaluations for houses but it seems it takes
a lot of time to do so. from checking tables and searching on maps for data, the
process of creating these evaluations could be sped up by automation.

the evaluation consists of an excel document in which the architect will include

**** TODO actually do name the things properly

**** TODO learn how to use sql in python and make it easier for me to dump the databases


** create and store a database of a value table for Cuidad Juarez
*** requirements
  This database will include: [/]
    - [ ] sectors
    - [ ] zip codes
    - [ ] blocks
    - [ ] age/conservation tables
    - [ ] prizes of areas per street
    - [ ] prizes of areas per block
    - [ ] TODO add more definitions for the tables
*** things to keep in mind
    - "claves catastrales" are composed of sector-block-lot
    - sectors may cover al lest one colonies.
    - sectors may cover at least one zip code.
    - colonies may cover at least one sectors.
    - colonies may cover at least one zip code.
    - zip codes may cover at least one sector.
    - zip codes may cover at least one colony.
    - more than one colony may have the same zip code.

*** implementation ideas
    im using SQLite3 simply because is a local project.

** create a script that creates evaluation excel sheets automatically
*** requirements [0/12]
  - [ ] The automatic format creator shall create a evaluation excel sheet
  - [ ] That is mainly broken into sections
  - [ ] Sections shall be self contained.
  - [ ] Sections are agnostic of other sections.
  - [ ] The sections shall have a title.

  - [ ] Cells shall be able to have different Colors.
  - [ ] Cells shall be able to have different Accents.

*** implementation [0/2]
  - The sections shall be stored in a custom file format.
  - The file format contains the information of the sections.
  - A section believes the only thing in the excel sheet is them.
  - Sections may me be feed in json format after being processed.(or maybe the section is defined in json and just send it hard to the formatter)
  - Processing refers to tell the formatter the actual position in the. excel sheet.
  - At the beginning the sections are based from a relative origin which is based from the y axis.
  - as the sections get created the absolute hight gets added to their relative height.
  - sections may describe the titles and the list of allowed values in their descriptions


** Create a Gui that fills the data required for the excel evaluations
*** requirements [0/1]
    - [ ] The gui shall shall a form-like interaction per section
    - [ ] If The data requires a type of look up it shall be done after submission.
    - [ ]The gui shall have a final evaluation view  before sending generating the excel document.
    - [ ] after section any of the sections is  finished the program shall store the data
    - [ ] sections shall contain preselected options for easier form filling
    - [ ] pre selected sections shall be stored in presets made by the user
*** implementation [/]
    - View Controller Model system.
    - [[http://usingpython.com/making-widgets-look-nice/][gui look and feel set up.]]
    - [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7546050/switch-between-two-frames-in-tkinter][wizard style.]]
    - posible pallets
